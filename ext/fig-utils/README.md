# MATLAB-Figure-Utilities
Simple utilities for managing the positioning of bunch of on-screen figure windows in MATLAB.

This package contains 3 trivial figure management utilities I can't live without:
* `SHOWMETHEFIGS` Allow user to cycle between all figures by hitting any key
* `FIGSHIFT` Cascades current figure window away from previous figure
* `FILLSCREEN` Set a figure size to completely fill the screen. NOTE: There's a better version built into MATLAB since R2018a. Just set the `WindowState` property to `'maximized'`
